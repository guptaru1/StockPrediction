Traditional statistical as well as artificial intel-
ligence techniques are widely used for stock
market forecasting. Due to the non linearity
in stock data, a model developed using the tra-
ditional or a single intelligent technique may
not accurately predict results. The term stock
trend refers to the movement of the stock go-
ing up if the price increases versus the stock
going down if the price decreases.Exploitation
of the efficient search optimization technique
of genetic algorithms combined with a long-
term and short-term memory neural network
(LSTM)-based prediction model can help in
identifying an optimal subset of stock techni-
cal indicators along with the time-steps to look
back for accurate stock prediction. The main
research question we aim to explore is how can
feature engineering benefit model prediction accuracy?

To optimize the run-time, parallelization was implemented as can be seen in the diagram below.
